### Project completed as part of Dataquest's Data Engineering path.

## Introduction

In this project, we will build a database for storing data related to crimes that occurred in Boston. 

Our goal is to create a database named crimes_db with a table – boston_crimes – inside a schema named crimes with appropriate datatypes for storing the data from the boston.csv file. Also, we will create readonly and readwrite groups with the appropriate privileges. Lastly, we will create one user for each of these groups.
